### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Kevin ([wd:Q57303201](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57303201)) 

I am a software developer at [deepsearch](https://deepassist.com/de/startseite/), and I am passionate about knowledge graphs.

## ðŸ”­ Hobby Projects

### KG-based recommendations
Together with Eleni Ilkou, I am working on a KG-based recommendation engine for an e-learning platform, on which students collaborate in groups for a project. Using named entity recognition on the search queries of students and their group members, we aim to infer their current interests and provide good query suggestions. Related repositories are:

*Repositories will be published later after the paper gets accepted.*

### Exploratory Search System (inactive)
I was working on an exploratory search system which can be applied to any RDF-based knowledge graph that is aligned to a rich ontology. This system provides an adaptive user interface with different search paradigms such as full-text search, tree views and faceted navigation. You can see my workshop paper for details: [Enabling Exploratory Search on Manufacturing Knowledge Graphs](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3253/paper2.pdf) | [(Slides)](https://kevinhaller.dev/papers/22-voila-slides.pdf).

* [khaller93/es-middleware](https://github.com/khaller93/es-middleware) - Middleware offering exploratory search services for a general knowledge graph over a HTTP+JSON API.
* [khaller93/es-web-app](https://github.com/khaller93/es-web-app) - Single-page web application providing an user interface for exploring knowledge graphs in a human-friendly manner.
