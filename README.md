### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Kevin ([wd:Q57303201](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q57303201)) 

I am a software engineer, and I am passionate about knowledge graphs.

## ðŸ”­ Projects

### KG-based recommendations
Together with Eleni Ilkou, I am working on a KG-based recommendation engine for an e-learning platform, on which students collaborate in groups for a project. Using named entity recognition on the search queries of students and their group members, we aim to infer their current interests and provide good query suggestions. Related repositories are:

* [kgrec-train](https://github.com/khaller93/kgrec-train) - Training KG embeddings and conventional relatedness algorithms.
* [dbpedia-kg-neo4j](https://github.com/khaller93/dbpedia-kg-neo4j/tree/sampling) - Simple docker-compose file to populate and run a Neo4J graph database with DBpedia KG.
* [dbpedia-forestfire-sampling](https://github.com/khaller93/dbpedia-forestfire-sampling) - Subsampling the DBpedia KG using the forest-fire model.
* [entity-relatedness-evaluation-datasets](https://github.com/khaller93/entity-relatedness-evaluation-datasets) - A collection of evaluation datasets for entity/word relatedness, and link of named entities to DBpedia IRIs.

*More will be published later after the paper gets accepted.*

### Exploratory Search System (inactive)
I was working on an exploratory search system which can be applied to any RDF-based knowledge graph that is aligned to a rich ontology. This system provides an adaptive user interface with different search paradigms such as full-text search, tree views and faceted navigation. These repositories are currently private, unfortunately. You can see my workshop paper for details: [Enabling Exploratory Search on Manufacturing Knowledge Graphs](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3253/paper2.pdf) | [(Slides)](https://kevinhaller.dev/papers/22-voila-slides.pdf).
