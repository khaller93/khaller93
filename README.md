### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Kevin

I am a software developer at [deepsearch](https://deepassist.com/de/startseite/), and I am passionate about knowledge graphs.

## ðŸ”­ Side projects

### PokÃ©mon Knowledge Graph
PokemonKG is a knowledge graph that aims to encapsulate the rich and detailed world of PokÃ©mon as portrayed in both games and the anime television series. The current PokemonKG was assembled by integrating information from various community-driven platforms. You can see more details here:

 * [pokemonkg.org](https://pokemonkg.org/) - Website describing the project.
 * [github.com/pokemon-kg](https://github.com/pokemon-kg) - Repositories of the project.

### Exploratory Search System (inactive)
The exploratory search system can be applied to any RDF-based knowledge graph that is aligned to a rich ontology. This system provides an adaptive user interface with different search paradigms such as full-text search, tree views and faceted navigation. You can see my workshop paper for details: [Enabling Exploratory Search on Manufacturing Knowledge Graphs](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3253/paper2.pdf) | [(Slides)](https://kevinhaller.dev/papers/22-voila-slides.pdf).

* [khaller93/es-middleware](https://github.com/khaller93/es-middleware) - Middleware offering exploratory search services for a general knowledge graph over a HTTP+JSON API.
* [khaller93/es-web-app](https://github.com/khaller93/es-web-app) - Single-page web application providing an user interface for exploring knowledge graphs in a human-friendly manner.
